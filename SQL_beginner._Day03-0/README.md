## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D03_01](misc/images/D03_01.png)

Relation Theory is a mathematical foundation for modern Relational Databases. Every databases’ aspect has corresponding mathematical and logical justification. Including INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE operators. (Dr. Edgar Frank Codd is on the picture).

How the INSERT operator works from a mathematical point of view.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`INSERT rel RELATION {TUPLE {A INTEGER(4),B INTEGER(4),C STRING ('Hello') }};` | You can use mathematical INSERT statements and integrate “tuple” construction to convert an incoming data to row. |
| From the other side, you can use explicit assignment with the UNION operator. | `rel:=rel UNION RELATION {TUPLE {A INTEGER(4), B INTEGER (7), C STRING ('Hello')}};` |

What’s about the DELETE statement?

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`DELETE rel WHERE A = 1;` | If you want to delete a row for A = 1, you can do it in a direct way. |
| ... or by using a new assignment without key A = 1 | `rel:=rel WHERE NOT (A = 1);` |

... and finally UPDATE statement. Also there are 2 cases.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`UPDATE rel WHERE A = 1 {B:= 23*A, C:='String #4'};` | Update statement from mathematical point of view |
| New assignment for relation variable rel based on CTE and working with Sets | `rel:=WITH (rel WHERE A = 1) AS T1, (EXTEND T1 ADD (23*A AS NEW_B, 'String #4' AS NEW_C)) AS T2, T2 {ALL BUT B,C} AS T3, (T3 RENAME (NEW _B AS B, NEW _C AS C)) AS T4: (S MINUS T1) UNION T4;` |

The last case with UPDATE statement is really interesting, because in other words you add a new tuple and after that make a MINUS of the old row. The same behavior in physical implementation! Actually, `UPDATE = DELETE + INSERT` and there is a special term “Tombstone” status for a particular deleted/updated row.  Then if you have a lot of Tombstones then you have a bad TPS metric and you need to control your dead data!

Let’s make a cheese of our data! :-)


## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Please find a union of pizzerias that have been visited either women or men. Other words, you should find a set of pizzerias names have been visited by females only and make "UNION" operation with set of pizzerias names have been visited by males only. Please be aware with word “only” for both genders. For any SQL operators with sets save duplicates (`UNION ALL`, `EXCEPT ALL`, `INTERSECT ALL` constructions). Please sort a result by the pizzeria name. The data sample is provided below.
