## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D02_01](misc/images/D02_01.png)

In the picture, you can see a Relational Expression in Tree View. This expression corresponds the next SQL query 

    SELECT *
        FROM R CROSS JOIN S
    WHERE clause

So, in other words we can describe any SQL in mathematical terms of Relational Algebra.

The main question (which I hear from my students) is why do we need to learn Relational Algebra in a course, if we can write a SQL in a first attempt? My answer is yes and no in one time. “Yes” means you can write a SQL from the first attempt, that’s right , “No” means you have to know the main aspects of Relational Algebra, because this knowledge is in use for optimization plans and for semantic queries. 
Which type of joins are existing in Relational Algebra?
Actually, “Cross Join” is a primitive operator and it is an anchestor for other types of joins.
- Natural Join
- Theta Join
- Semi Join
- Anti Join
- Left / Right / Full Joins 

But what does a join operation between 2 tables mean? Let me present a part of pseudo code, how join operation works without indexing. 

    FOR r in R LOOP
        FOR s in S LOOP
        if r.id = s.r_id then add(r,s)
        …
        END;
    END;

It’s just a set of loops ... Not magic at all




## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.
