## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D01_01](misc/images/D01_01.png)

In many aspects, sets are used in Relational Databases. Not just, make UNION or find MINUS between sets. Sets are also good candidates to make recursive queries.

There are the next set operators in PostgreSQL. 
- UNION [ALL]
- EXCEPT [ALL] 
- INTERSECT [ALL]

Keyword “ALL” means to save duplicates of rows in the result.
The main rules to work with sets are below
- The main SQL provides a final names of attributes for whole query
- The attributes of controlled SQL should satisfied number of columns and corresponding family types of main SQL

![D01_02](misc/images/D01_02.png)

Moreover, SQL sets are useful  to calculate some specific Data Science metrics, for example Jaccard distance between 2 objects based on existing data features.


## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Please modify a SQL statement from “exercise 00” by removing the object_id column. Then change ordering by object_name for part of data from the `person` table and then from `menu` table (like presented on a sample below). Please save duplicates!

Actually, please add ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_id in descending mode.

Let's return our mind back to exercise #03 and change our SQL statement to return person names instead of person identifiers and change ordering by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_name in descending mode. Please take a look at a data sample below.

| action_date | person_name |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2022-01-01 | Irina |
| 2022-01-01 | Anna |
| 2022-01-01 | Andrey |

Please write a SQL statement which returns the date of order from the `person_order` table and corresponding person name (name and age are formatted as in the data sample below) which made an order from the `person` table. Add a sort by both columns in ascending mode.

| order_date | person_information |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2022-01-01 | Andrey (age:21) |
| 2022-01-01 | Andrey (age:21) |
